From the church tower, looking out over the valleys around, you might, on a good day, have had a spectacular view of rolling undulations, some forested, others crisscrossed by hedges, sloping down to the sea, or rising into further hills on the distant horizon. On Sundays and feast days, a certain proportion of the village would also have been seen making its way from farms and cottages and entering the door below you.</description></item><item><title>Up on a Hill</title><link>https://articles.lakurdina.com/poems/up-on-a-hill/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Mar 2022 18:11:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://articles.lakurdina.com/poems/up-on-a-hill/</guid><description>A Garden
Alight in Spring sun
I walk through endless dancing trees
To where the mulberries grow
In Summer,
I stand amongst the waving fronds
Look up and see the sky
Light blue
Streaked with whispy clouds,
High in a hedge a blackbird sings
Sweet lyricisms of note,
Down below a field vole moves

And see in shimmering quality all that lies below,
The candlescent trout of yesteryear
All swimming through a warm, enchanted glow;
High on a brough the soft, unflinching moon
Casts gaudy shadows round about
The greying hairs upon thy mortal head
And sees no sound more anxious than the quails;
There we met in happy, joyful times
A thousand finches trailing to a stream,</description></item></channel></rss>
