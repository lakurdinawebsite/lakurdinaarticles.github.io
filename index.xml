Here you will find articles on a wide variety of topics, from politics, art and music through to astrophysics and organic chemistry. The aim is to provide content covering all walks of life, but particularly those aspects of it relating to philosophy.
This site relies heavily on work from contributors. There are a small number of regular contributors, but if you would like to provide content of any description that is also welcomed.</description></item><item><title>Contribute</title><link>https://articles.lakurdina.com/contribute/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Feb 2022 14:39:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://articles.lakurdina.com/contribute/</guid><description>I am very happy to consider contributions of articles for this site. The single criterion is that they must &amp;ldquo;make me think more than they make me swear&amp;rdquo;, not a big ask considering my peaceable nature and predilection for thinking.
If you think you can achieve this, and have work you would like to submit, please email contribute.articles@lakurdina.com
All work will be attributed based on the information you choose to provide.</description></item></channel></rss>
