Here you will find articles on a wide variety of topics, from art and music through to astrophysics and organic chemistry, as well as poems and short stories.
This site relies heavily on work from contributors. We have a small number of regular contributors, but if you would like to provide content of any description that is also welcomed. For more information, please visit our contribute page.</description></item><item><title>Contribute</title><link>https://articles.lakurdina.com/contribute/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Feb 2022 14:39:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://articles.lakurdina.com/contribute/</guid><description>I am very happy to consider contributions of articles for this site. The single criterion is that they must &amp;ldquo;make me think more than they make me swear&amp;rdquo;, not a big ask considering my peaceable nature and predilection for thinking.
Contributions of other material, such as poems and stories, are considered on the same basis.
If you think you can achieve this, and have work you would like to submit, please email contribute.</description></item></channel></rss>
