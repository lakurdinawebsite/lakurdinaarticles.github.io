Nomatter how far back in history you go, it has always been the case that arguments will have two sides, and that people will take both of those sides with equal conviction. Our ability to do so is, arguably, one of the most important facets of our humanity, and is what differentiates us from many other gregarious species, such as sheep and wildebeest, for whom survival depends on consensus.</p><p>What seems to be new, or perhaps not but it feels like it is increasingly prevalent, is the assumption that the side of the argument on which you stand is necessarily the <em>right</em> one, and that your oponents must all lack basic intelligence, because they could not possibly hold their position otherwise.</p><p>As the first article published on Lakurdina Articles, I hope this will lay the basis of the work that is to come, informing how readers interpret it and giving an overview of the biases that I hold. Here I look at some of the most heated issues of our times and examine whether any logical thought goes into the ways in which the arguments on both sides are conducted. I also set out what I consider to be the most fundamental truths for all free-thinking individuals, as well as the ways in which I believe our modern society has forgotten them. You might say that it is ironic, or even hypocritical, that I am making an argument about why our arguments are flawed, but I do so without the expectation that what I say is necessarily true, and hope that if anyone reading this feels inclined to make an opposing argument they will submit an article through the <a href=https://articles.lakurdina.com/contribute>contribute</a> page.</p><p>Whilst I had been intending to write this article anyway, the events of the past few days (as I write) in Ukraine have made the subject all the more important. If you read this at this time, I ask that you consider the discussion around the actions of all involved through through the lens of what you are about to read, should you consider it to be of value.</p><h2 id=humpty-dumpty---outrage-and-offense>Humpty Dumpty - Outrage and Offense</h2><p>Wherever you gather your information, be it through traditional media sources, first hand experience or social media, it is impossible not to notice the fractiousness, entrenchment and fragility of the discussion and arguments being made. From the COVID-19 vaccine, to civil rights, to the environment, to foreign policy, there seems to be an assumption that there is only one argument to be had: a binary one of right and wrong, in which both sides believe that they are right and the other is wrong.</p><p>To take the, rather controversial, example of the vaccine as a starting point, the argument seems to have got to the point where on one side anyone who does not have the vaccine is putting society in danger, acting irresponsibly and, most damningly, being selfish to a wanton degree, whilst on the other the it is a way of implanting microchips into people, causes infertility and will leave all who have had it dead in eighteen months. This automatically leads to large amounts of misinformation being spread by both sides of the argument in an attempt to drown out the voice of the other, and means that any actual arguments surrounding whether this misinformation is true or not will lead to the person making them being ostracised by both sides. For example, if you were to say to the pro-vaccine side that there may be evidence that having the vaccine does not necessarily meaningfully reduce your chance of giving the virus <em>to others,</em> you will be accused of being (that dirty word) an antivaccer, whilst if you say that the size of the needle is too small to allow for microchip implantation you will be accused of being hopelessly naive, having been brainwashed, or being in the pay of the government.</p><p>This is not healthy for discourse around the subject, as the absolute entrenchment of both sides means that the valid discussion somewhere in the middle ground cannot be had. I would even go so far as to say that, in the attitude of &lsquo;you are either with us or you are evil&rsquo; which both sides seem to have, <em>both</em> are acting rather like conspiracy theories, dismissing any facts which are not convenient to them.</p><p>The fact that it has become the norm for people, particularly on social media and inlarge media companies, to call for sackings, deplatformings or the &lsquo;cancellation&rsquo; of those with whom they disagree, on the grounds that their opinions are somehow &lsquo;dangerous&rsquo; or cause offence can, in my opinion, lead in only one direction. Where there are certain opinions that are considered problematic to hold by general society, it is only natural that those who hhold them will be driven together. In this case, it is almost inevitable that many of those to whom they are driven will hold even more extreme views, and with the human need to find a community in which to belong the people with sane but unpopular opinions will end up being pushed into holding extreme views as well. It is a necessary and healthy thing for a society to have the ability to have open and honest discussions of everything under the Sun, as without that ability unpopular opinions will grow beneath the surface like some kind of cancer, rather than being properly aired, pulled around, examined for weaknesses and, in some cases, torn to shreds and destroyed.</p><p>Freedom of speech is supposedly one of the most fundamental values upon which democratic societies are founded, and is one which all people in those societies benefit from every day. As such, there can be no excuse for its curtailment on any grounds, nomatter how &lsquo;righteous&rsquo; they may appear, because as soon as a precendent is set it becomes easy to extend it further and further. In dictatorships around the world, and throughout history, one abiding feature is the fact that certain topics of conversation, or viewpoints within those topics, are considered to be unacceptable to have or to hold, and that is condemned by democratic states. What, then, is the true difference between the government curtailing that freedom because a certain part of society (albeit the government itself) does not like it in a dictatorship, and the government curtailing that freedom because part of society has a problem with it in a democracy? I can see none, can you?</p><p>In addition, the abject public apologies that people, particularly in the US, are being forced to make after &rsquo;transgressing&rsquo; in the opinion of &rsquo;the internet&rsquo; hold striking and somewhat disturbing similarities to those made by political prisoners in dictatorships, and, to use an old cliche, the public admissions of guilt made by the same people in 1984.</p><p>In all, the way in which our society is tending is grounds for serious concern. If things continue as they are, we will, almost inevitably, end up in a situation where our democracies are eroded by the curtailment of free speach; where a small group of people determine what we are able to say; where truth is silenced in the face of outrage and offense. Culture is a precarious thing, sitting, like Humpty Dumpty, atop the wall of popular opinion, and awaiting the day where it is tipped over the edge to come crashing to the ground. Let us not cause this to happen.</p><figure><img src=https://articles.lakurdina.com/images/fireandice.1.jpg alt="The Ruin of Society" width=90%><figcaption><p>The Ruin of Society</p></figcaption></figure><h2 id=the-rules-of-engagement>The Rules of Engagement</h2><p>In order for meaningful discussions, whether public or private, to be able to be conducted, it is necessary for a number of basic rules to be followed by those engaging in them. Without these, it is impossible to engage in discourse in a civil manner and it will quickly deteriorate into a slanging match in which each side attacks the character of the other, disregarding entirely the quality of the arguments put forth.</p><p>Firstly, and most importantly, it is necessary for everyone to be fully informed of what is being discussed. By this, I do not simply mean that everyone must know what is thought about it by their own echochamber, but rather that they must have done proper research from all different angles. Failing this, they must at least know that they are not fully informed.</p><p>Secondly, it is important to approach the discussion with an open mind. This does not necessarily mean that you must be prepared to have your mind changed, but simply that it is important to acknowledge that your opinion is not necessarily the only one that is correct. Nothing is undoubtable, and it is healthy to have you ideas challenged.</p><p>Thirdly, and possibly most importantly, remain civil. Your interlocutor is not an idiot, simply another flawed human being who potentially holds different opinions to you yourself. Someone once said to me &ldquo;If you think that everyone around you is a dickhead, it is probably you who are.&rdquo; It is important to remember this, and to act accordingly.</p><p>I could probably add a huge number of further rules, but for the sake of brevity will leave it here, as these are probably the most important.</p><h2 id=thoughts-to-take-away>Thoughts to Take Away</h2><p>The title of this article is possibly not the most apt under the circumstances. With it, I was aiming to illustrate the division, but if it is taken in a more literal sense it gives entirely the wrong impression, as &lsquo;ice&rsquo; would suggest apathy and coldness rather than a fiery and argumentative force. Calling the article &lsquo;Fire and Fire&rsquo;, howebver, would also not have worked, as it would have done a less good job of illustrating the divisive nature of the issue.</p><p>Whilst much of what is said above may appear obvious to most people, I feel that it is important to express it as, all too often, it seems to be being forgotten by much of society. Indeed, I often find that I forget it myself and am drawn into arguments containing far too much heat for the subject being discussed. I implore all reasoned, reasoning and reasonable individuals not to forget the importance of reason in debate.</p><p>There is so much more that could be said on this topic, but rather than diving into the controversial subjects of the day in an article that is supposed to set a scene for what is to come, I will instead save writing about them for future work.</p><p>Finally, I pray you, take heed of what you say and do. Are you equally exasperated with how discourse is being carried out, or are you actually a part of the problem?</p><p>Comments are welcomed below, as well as submissions of articles relating to this, or any other, subject. Before sending a torrent of abuse, however, remember, as it says on the Lakurdina homepage, &ldquo;Our aim is to challenge common and established views where we feel that they lack sanity, whilst retaining a strong basis in reality. We hope that readers will find our articles thought provoking, and appreciate them as such.&rdquo;</p><div class="share-icons d-flex justify-content-center d-print-none"><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3a%2f%2farticles.lakurdina.com%2farticles%2f2022%2f02%2ffire-and-ice-a-world-divided%2f&text=Fire%20and%20Ice%20-%20a%20World%20Divided&tw_p=tweetbutton" class=p-2 title="Share on Twitter" target=_blank rel=nofollow><div><span class=fa-stack><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
