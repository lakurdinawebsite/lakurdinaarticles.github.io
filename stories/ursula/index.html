<p><span style=display:inline-block;width:2em></span>In a time of no importance, a village stood on a hill. From the church tower, looking out over the valleys around, you might, on a good day, have had a spectacular view of rolling undulations, some forested, others crisscrossed by hedges, sloping down to the sea, or rising into further hills on the distant horizon. On Sundays and feast days, a certain proportion of the village would also have been seen making its way from farms and cottages and entering the door below you.<br>
<span style=display:inline-block;width:2em></span>On one particular day, and on many others, but that holds no significance, what you would not have seen is a girl of about fifteen amongst that crowd. If realising this, you had decided to look for her, you would have found her lying on an old hessian sack beneath the hedge surrounding a field called Charmerie at the south end of the village. She is I, and I was once her.<br>
<span style=display:inline-block;width:2em></span>From my vantage point, I have a fine view of nodding daffodils growing in warm seclusion in the encompassing shelter of the hawthorns, beyond them, soft waves of grass, brilliant with new growth, painting a striking green over the field, and to the other hedge. Bright golden light throws snaking, wavering trails of shadow across the meadow; high above, the endless, golden pouring of a skylark&rsquo;s song is just audible over the soughing of the wind in leaf and branch. I lie, silent, waiting, absorbed in peace and time, as they are in me.<br>
<span style=display:inline-block;width:2em></span>Time passes, the church bells cease their tolling, and an endless, quivering silence encompasses me. Even the skylark, perhaps bored in his pursuit, perhaps merely in need of sustainance, has ceased his song. My eyes close, and I drift into warm, comfortable sleep.<br>
<span style=display:inline-block;width:2em></span>Some time later, I hear the jingling of bells, and a girl of about my age enters the field through a gap in the hedge on my left. She walks to the middle of the field, golden hair made more golden by the golden light rippling behind her as she goes, and her grass green dress waving and swirling in the light breeze. She turns twice on the spot, not slowly, not fast, but as though establishing her position in its centre, and then makes straight for me in my position beneath the prickly branches.<br>
<span style=display:inline-block;width:2em></span>"A day to you," she says. &ldquo;And where might I be finding it?&rdquo;<br>
<span style=display:inline-block;width:2em></span>Slightly puzzled, I look into her deep, green eyes and say &ldquo;And to you, for what are you searching?&rdquo;<br>
<span style=display:inline-block;width:2em></span>"The day," she says. &ldquo;I seek the day. Come with me.&rdquo;<br>
<span style=display:inline-block;width:2em></span>My reverie being over, I get up. She takes my hand and leads me down to the forrest down the hill; squats, looking intently at the water of the stream, and smiles. With strong, quick fingers, she unbuttons my dress. I let it fall to the ground and look at her quizically as she does the same with hers and slips into a pool in the stream.<br>
<span style=display:inline-block;width:2em></span>"Come," she says. &ldquo;There is nothing to fear.&rdquo;<br>
<span style=display:inline-block;width:2em></span>Cautiously I follow, feeling the thrill of cold as the water encloses my bare skin. We lie, facing one another across the pool, our feet just meeting between us, warm amidst the cool water. Birds sing around us, and I see a thin gold thread woven amidst the wet gold of her hair; a deer barked; a small fish, born of the water, and bourne by it, flashed silvery over the slight waterfall behind me and on downstream.<br>
<span style=display:inline-block;width:2em></span>I do not know how long we lie there, minutes, hours, half a day, with the forms of endless dreamlike visions coming before me, but eventually I begin to shiver in earnest and step out of the pool. I slip my dress on and turn to speak to my companion. She is gone; her dress, so green and vibrant, is gone, despite the fact that I had to move it to reach mine. I shiver, and run back to the field as fast as I can.<br>
<span style=display:inline-block;width:2em></span>Still cold, I stand soaking in the sun&rsquo;s warmth; feeling the wind on my skin; hearing the skylarks&rsquo; song, so high and clear, trailing in eternal melody out into the sky. I ponder and I wonder: who was she, how came she to this field, and whence has she gone? All about her was mystery, and so it seems it shall remain. Eventually, warmed through and regaining my courage, I return to my spot under the hedge, and thence, seeing the sun sink, hearing the church clock strike, and feeling a nip in the air, back to the warm arms of home.<br>
<span style=display:inline-block;width:2em></span>As I walk along the street, a young man smiles and greets me, standing at the door of the smith&rsquo;s shop with a hot fiery glow behind him. Being shy, I simply nod in reply and quicken my pace to a jog, feeling his eyes follow me as I go on. I know him by sight, he goes to the church most Sundays, and I have seen him there, but I do not know his name and the fact that he greeted me by mine unnerves me slightly in my still dreamy and apprehensive state.<br>
<span style=display:inline-block;width:2em></span>Home, and the warm glow of the fire in the hearth, in such contrast to the chilliness of the evening, welcomes me inside. At dinner, I feel dreamy but content, and the soft warmth of my bed welcomes me into its arms like an old returning friend. I lie and think of what has past, but soon am overtaken by sleep.<br>
<span style=display:inline-block;width:2em></span>Such wonders, and what will tomorrow bring?</p></div></div><div class="menu-contextual d-print-none d-none d-xl-block">
