From the church tower, looking out over the valleys around, you might, on a good day, have had a spectacular view of rolling undulations, some forested, others crisscrossed by hedges, sloping down to the sea, or rising into further hills on the distant horizon.

Alight in Spring sun
I walk through endless dancing trees
To where the mulberries grow
In Summer,
I stand amongst the waving fronds
Look up and see the sky

Streaked with whispy clouds,
High in a hedge a blackbird sings
Sweet lyricisms of note,
Down below a field vole moves
In scurrying haste to find
The food that will sustain her,
I wander up through fields of green</description></item></channel></rss>
