I am very happy to consider contributions of articles for this site. The single criterion is that they must "make me think more than they make me swear", not a big ask considering my peaceable nature and predilection for thinking.  

Contributions of other material, such as poems and stories, are considered on the same basis.

If you think you can achieve this, and have work you would like to submit, please email
    contribute.lakurdinaarticles@pm.me  

For security reasons, I ask that all submissions are either included in email text or attached as simple text files. Any other attachments will be ignored and the messages will be deleted.
