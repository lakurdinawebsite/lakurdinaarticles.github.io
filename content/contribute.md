I am very happy to consider contributions of articles for this site. The single criterion is that they must "make me think more than they make me swear", not a big ask considering my peaceable nature and predilection for thinking.  

Contributions of material for other Lakurdina sites are considered on the same basis.

All work will be attributed based on the information you choose to provide. You can be as public, or as anonymous, as you wish.

If you think you can achieve this, and have work you would like to submit, please email
    contribute.lakurdinaarticles@pm.me  

For security reasons, I ask that all submissions are either included in email text or attached as simple text files. Any other attachments will be ignored and the messages will be deleted.
