I am very happy to consider contributions of articles for this site. The single criterion is that they must "make me think more than they make me swear", not a big ask considering my peaceable nature and predilection for thinking.

If you think you can achieve this, and have work you would like to submit, please email
    contribute.articles@lakurdina.com
    
All work will be attributed based on the information you choose to provide. You can be as public, or as anonymous, as you wish.

For security reasons, I ask that all submissions are either included in email text or attached as simple text files. Any other attachments will be ignored and the messages will be deleted.

Please do not add this email to mailing lists, or use it for any other unauthorised purposes. Also, please refrain from sending anything apart from genuine contributions. Do not email with requests to promote products or services, or to put any kind of advertising on this site. Failure to comply with these rules will lead to your email address being permanently blocked. There are no second chances.
