{{< indent >}}In a time of no importance, a village stood on a hill. From the church tower, looking out over the valleys around, you might, on a good day, have had a spectacular view of rolling undulations, some forested, others crisscrossed by hedges, sloping down to the sea, or rising into further hills on the distant horizon. On Sundays and feast days, a certain proportion of the village would also have been seen making its way from farms and cottages and entering the door below you.  
{{< indent >}}On one particular day, and on many others, but that holds no significance, what you would not have seen is a girl of about eleven or twelve amongst that crowd. If realising this, you had decided to look for her, you would have found her lying on an old hessian sack beneath the hedge surrounding a field called Charmerie at the south end of the village. She is I, and I was once her.  
{{< indent >}}From my vantage point, I have a fine view of nodding daffodils growing in warm seclusion in the encompassing shelter of the hawthorns, beyond them, soft waves of grass, brilliant with new growth, painting a striking green over the field, and to the other hedge. Bright golden light throws snaking, wavering trails of shadow across the meadow; high above, the endless, golden pouring of a skylark's song is just audible over the soughing of the wind in leaf and branch. I lie, silent, waiting, absorbed in peace and time, as they are in me.  
{{< indent >}}Time passes, the church bells cease their tolling, and an endless, quivering silence encompasses me. Even the skylark, perhaps bored in his pursuit, perhaps merely in need of sustainance, has ceased his song. My eyes close, and I drift into warm, comfortable sleep.  
{{< indent >}}Some time later, I hear the jingling of bells, and a girl of about my age enters the field through a gap in the hedge on my left. She walks to the middle of the field, golden hair made more golden by the golden light rippling behind her as she goes, and her grass green dress waving and swirling in the light breeze. She turns twice on the spot, not slowly, not fast, but as though establishing her position in its centre, and then makes straight for me in my position beneath the prickly branches.  
{{< indent >}}"A day to you," she says. "And where might I be finding it?"  
{{< indent >}}Slightly puzzled, I look into her deep, green eyes and say "And to you, for what are you searching?"  
{{< indent >}}"The day," she says. "I seek the day. Come with me."  
{{< indent >}}My reverie being over, I get up. She takes my hand and leads me down to the forrest down the hill; squats, looking intently at the water of the stream, and smiles. With strong, quick fingers, she unbuttons my dress. I let it fall to the ground and look at her quizically as she does the same with hers and slips into a pool in the stream.  
{{< indent >}}"Come," she says. "There is nothing to fear."  
{{< indent >}}Cautiously I follow, feeling the thrill of cold as the water encloses my bare skin. We lie, facing one another across the pool, our feet just meeting between us, warm amidst the cool water. Birds sing around us, and I see a thin gold thread woven amidst the wet gold of her hair; a deer barked; a small fish, born of the water, and bourne by it, flashed silvery over the slight waterfall behind me and on downstream.  
{{< indent >}}I do not know how long we lay there, minutes, hours, half a day, with the forms of
