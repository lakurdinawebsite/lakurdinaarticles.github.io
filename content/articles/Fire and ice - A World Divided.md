## Introduction  

Our World is divided. Nomatter how far back in history you go, it has always been the case that arguments will have two sides, and that people will take both of those sides with equal conviction. Our ability to do so is, arguably, one of the most important facets of our humanity, and is what differentiates us from many other gregarious species, such as sheep and wildebeest, for whom survival depends on consensus.  

What seems to be new, or perhaps not but it feels like it is increasingly prevalent, is the assumption that the side of the argument on which you stand is necessarily the *right* one, and that your oponents must all lack basic intelligence, because they could not possibly hold their position otherwise.

As the first article published on Lakurdina Articles, I hope this will lay the basis of the work that is to come, informing how readers interpret it and giving an overview of the biases that I hold. Here I set out what I consider to be the most fundamental truths for all free-thinking individuals, as well as the ways in which I believe our modern society has forgotten them. I also look at some of the most heated issues of our times and examine whether any logical thought goes into the ways in which the arguments on both sides are conducted. You might say that it is ironic, or even hypocritical, that I am making an argument about why our arguments are flawed, but I do so without the expectation that what I say is necessarily true, and hope that if anyone reading this feels inclined to make an opposing argument they will submit an article through the [contribute](articles.lakurdina.com/contribute) page.  

Whilst I had been intending to write this article anyway, the events of the past few days (as I write) in Ukraine have made the subject all the more important. If you read this at this time, I ask that you consider the discussion around the actions of all involved through through the lens of what you are about to read, should you consider it to be of value.  

## Humpty Dumpty - Outrage and Offense

Wherever you gather your information, be it through traditional media sources, first hand experience or social media, it is impossible not to notice the fractiousness, entrenchment and fragility of the discussion and arguments being made. From the COVID-19 vaccine, to civil rights, to the environment, to foreign policy, there seems to be an assumption that there is only one argument to be had: a binary one of right and wrong, in which both sides believe that they are right and the other is wrong.  

To take the, rather controversial, example of the vaccine as a starting point, the argument seems to have got to the point where on one side anyone who does not have the vaccine is putting society in danger, acting irresponsibly and, most damningly, being selfish to a wanton degree, whilst on the other the it is a way of implanting microchips into people, causes infertility and will leave all who have had it dead in eighteen months. This automatically leads to large amounts of misinformation being spread by both sides of the argument in an attempt to drown out the voice of the other, and means that any actual arguments surrounding whether this misinformation is true or not will lead to the person making them being ostracised by both sides. For example, if you were to say to the pro-vaccine side that there may be evidence that having the vaccine does not necessarily meaningfully reduce your chance of giving the virus *to others,* you will be accused of being (that dirty word) an antivaccer, whilst if you say that the size of the needle is too small to allow for microchip implantation you will be accused of being hopelessly naive, having been brainwashed, or being in the pay of the government.  

This is not healthy for discourse around the subject, as the absolute entrenchment of both sides means that the valid discussion somewhere in the middle ground cannot be had. I would even go so far as to say that, in the attitude of 'you are either with us or you are evil' which both sides seem to have, *both* are acting rather like conspiracy theories, dismissing any facts which are not convenient to them.

Now for another juicy one, and one which could very well lead to my being 'cancelled' as people are so fond of saying. The nature and meaning of gender and sex in our time is a somewhat fraught issue. On the one side, people say that differences between the genders are not 'really a thing', whilst on the other there is a more or less general acceptance amongst a large proportion of Western society that it is possible for people to be born with a different sex to what they *really* have.



Need to be able to have healthy discussion about everything.

Fundamental truths (nothing is undoubtable &c.)

Title of article perhaps not good. Fire hot, ice cold. Actually hot-hot.
