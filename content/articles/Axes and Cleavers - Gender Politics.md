**Insert Lead paragraph here.**


Now for another juicy one, and one which could very well lead to my being 'cancelled' as people are so fond of saying. The nature and meaning of gender and sex in our time is a somewhat fraught issue. On the one side, people say that differences between the genders are not 'really a thing', whilst on the other there is a more or less general acceptance amongst a large proportion of Western society that it is possible for people to be born with a different sex to what they *really* have.
