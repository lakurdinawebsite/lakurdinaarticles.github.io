## Contradictions and Counterarguments

The nature and meaning of sex and gender in our times is a somewhat fraught issue. Likewise, the relationship between the sexes is a matter of controversy. On top of these, with the tendency for outrage and offense at anything that is written on controversial topics, and the likelihood of being dragged through the mud at the least opportunity, I am very cautious about writing this article. I strongly believe, however, that the importance of these topics should outweigh any qualms that I might have, so taking my life in my hands I will write it anyway.  




***Now for another juicy one, and one which could very well lead to my being 'cancelled' as people are so fond of saying. The nature and meaning of gender and sex in our time is a somewhat fraught issue.
