A Garden  
Alight in Spring sun  
I walk through endless dancing trees  
To where the mulberries grow  
In Summer,  
I stand amongst the waving fronds  
Look up and see the sky  
Light blue  
Streaked with whispy clouds,  
High in a hedge a blackbird sings  
Sweet lyricisms of note,  
Down below a field vole moves  
In scurrying haste to find  
The food that will sustain her,  
I wander up through fields of green  
Then perch upon a hill  
The view stretches far  
Clouds float below  
A gentle haze obscures  
The Horizon,  
The flowers seek forall eternal joy  
And bring all forth in
Exquisite colour  
Of life.
