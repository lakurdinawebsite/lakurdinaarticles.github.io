We wander down through the lost pathways of the lake  
And see in shimmering quality all that lies below,  
The candlescent trout of yesteryear  
All swimming through a warm, enchanted glow;  

High on a brough the soft, unflinching moon  
Casts gaudy shadows round about  
The greying hairs upon thy mortal head  
And sees no sound more anxious than the quails;  

There we met in happy, joyful times  
A thousand finches trailing to a stream,  
There we saw through love's unfailing eyes  
A canteloupe slow turning in a dream  
Of future;  

In no old house whose walls have stood in June  
Can all but find the evanescent tune  
Of windytimes;  

Below water, encrystalled by the light,  
Lies and sleeps an old foresaken church,  
Where once the crowds thronged gleeful to the tune  
Of soft clear bells all ringing for bliss;  

I see no time where waiting in the breeze  
An eternal flame won't flicker with unease  
At what may come through all that is not known,  
Or silent bells ringing through endless shifting sands.
